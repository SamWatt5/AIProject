# 8-Puzzle AIProject

This project aims to create an AI-based solver for the classic 8-puzzle, where an initial configuration of numbered tiles is rearranged to match a target goal state using a minimal number of moves. We will implement and compare several search strategies—Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and other tree/graph search methods—to assess their performance in solving the puzzle efficiently. 

# Assignment Brief

Building on lecture materials and lab exercises, your task is to identify an interesting problem
that can be solved, at least in part, by three of the search strategies we have studied in the AI
part of the module. The choice of problem is unrestricted, but the size of the work must be
suitable for the available time (5 weeks) and group size (up to 5 people).
In choosing your problem and planning your work, keep in mind the four questions we have
discussed in class:
1. What is the AI problem that we want to solve?
2. Why it is an important problem to solve?
3. How can we solve it?
4. How can we solve it in a better way (faster, more robust, and efficient)?

You will need to produce a project proposal describing your problem and why it matters, the
dataset you will use, and what results you expect to get from the analysis. We will provide
feedback on this proposal in terms of scope and suitability of the project. Based on this feedback,
you should carry out any preparations of the data and infrastructure to solve your problem. You
should collect and interpret any results in terms of the problem definition, of the performance
of the chosen search strategies, and of their real-world meaning. Finally, you should critically
assess your work, identifying challenges, limitations, and opportunities for improvement. Pay
special attention to aspects of your approach that link the analysis to the algorithms involved
and their complexity (e.g. if you are forced to reduce the size of your dataset so that you can run
the analysis algorithms within your time and memory constraints).
You will report on your work in a 15-minute presentation to the lecturing team and the rest of
the class during Week 11. The presentation should focus on the problem and its relevance, and
the results and interpretation of your results, avoiding technical details. At the end of the project,
you will submit a written report in which you can describe in more detail your approach, the
strategies you used, your results and their interpretation, possible future enhancements, and
any relevant considerations linking your work to relevant algorithms and their complexity.
