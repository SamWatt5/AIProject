# AIProject

This project aims to create an AI-based solver for the classic 8-puzzle, where an initial configuration of numbered tiles is rearranged to match a target goal state using a minimal number of moves. We will implement and compare several search strategies—Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and other tree/graph search methods—to assess their performance in solving the puzzle efficiently.
